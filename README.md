# Castle Pines Landcover Classification

## Description
The Denver Metro Area is slowly inching towards a water crisis.  Years of drought and overusage of water have led many municipalities and water districts scrambling to find ways to alleviate water usage beyond tiered pricing structures.  The obvious first choice is to to educate homeowners and assist them in creating water budgets for landscape irrigation.  Areas of native grasses need significantly less water than turf, yet many homeowners are wasting thousands of gallons a year watering native grass for aesthetic purposes or out of ignorance.  To educate homeowners and create water budgets vegetation classification is needed, but many municipalities/metro districts do not have the finances
or manpower to survey properties accurately and are in need of a semi automated approach.  Utilizing Object Based Imagery Analysis would allow for an automated approach to classify large areas by vegetation type to calculate water budgets on a per lot basis.  

To complete this analysis high resolution imagery is needed in the Red, Green, Blue band wavelengths.  The Denver Regional Council of Governments does provide imagery for the metro district but it is 2 years old, and a resolution of 6 inches per pixel.  Higher resolution imagery can be acquired with small remote unmanned aerial systems but is time consuming and requires a significant amount of processing through proprietary software.
